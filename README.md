Several modules for Accessing PostgreSQL databases 

This is a collection of libaries that I made for accessing PostgreSQL databases in several languages, Ruby and Python versions are completely functional, while the Javascript one 
hasn't been properly tested. Tips about how to improve them while keeping them somewhat simple are welcome!
